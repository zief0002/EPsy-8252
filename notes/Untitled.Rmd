In this set of notes, you will learn another method of dealing with nonlinearity and also for dealing with heterogeneity of variance. Specifically, we will look at log-transforming the predictor in a linear model. To do so, we will use the *movies.csv* dataset (see the [data codebook](http://zief0002.github.io/epsy-8252/codebooks/movies.html)) to explain variation in movie budgets.
