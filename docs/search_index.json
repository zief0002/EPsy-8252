This is the second course of a two-semester sequence for students in education. Materials for the course can be found: Syllabus Assignments, Data, and Script Files Data Codebooks Course Content The statistical content for EPsy 8252 includes: (1) likelihood estimation and inference, (2) information criteria for model selection, (3) mixed-effects/multi-level models for analysis of cross-sectional data, (4) mixed-effects/multi-level models for analysis of longitudinal data, and (5) logistic models for analyzing dichotomous outcomes. Time permitting, miscellaneous topics (e.g., design weights, empirical Bayes estimation, semi-parametric models) will also be introduced. Books and Other Reading Materials This website will serve as the primary set of course notes. In addition, the following textbook is required: Fox, J. (2009). A mathematical primer for social statistics. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. There are also two optional textbooks: Anderson, D. R. (2008). Model based inference in the life sciences: A primer on evidence. New York: Springer. Dunteman, G. H., &amp; Ho, M.-H. R. (2006). An introduction to generalized linear models. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. Prerequisites Prerequisites include EPsy 8251: Methods in Data Analysis for Educational Research I, or a sound conceptual understanding of the topics of: Foundational topics in data analysis; Design (e.g., random assignment and random sampling) Descriptive statistics and plots One- and two-sample tests Correlation; Simple regression analysis; Model-level and coefficient-level interpretation Ordinary least squares estimation Model-level and coefficient-level inference Assumption checking/residual analysis Multiple linear regression Model-level and coefficient-level interpretation and inference Assumption checking/residual analysis Working with categorical predictors (including adjusting p-values for multiple tests) Interaction effects For the topics listed, students would be expected to be able to carry out an appropriate data analysis and properly interpret the results. It is also assumed that everyone enrolled in the course has some familiarity with using R. If you need a refresher on any of these topics, see the EPsy 8251 course notes. "],
["rmarkdown.html", "Unit 1: R Markdown Notes Other Resources", " Unit 1: R Markdown In this set of notes, you will learn how to integrate R syntax directly into your word-processed documents to create more reproducible reports. Preparation Before class you will need to do the following: Download the sample BibTeX file Download the CSL style file for the American Psychological Association 6th edition (single-spaced bibliography) from Zotero’s repository. Install the R package tinytex Notes The notes and files you will need can be found at: Unit 01: R Markdown [Class Notes] knitr::include_url(&quot;http://www.datadreaming.org/files/01-introduction-to-r.html#1&quot;) Other Resources In addition to the notes and what we cover in class, there many other resources for learning about R Markdown. Here are some resources that may be helpful in that endeavor: R Markdown documentation: Official R Markdown documentation from RStudio R Markdown cheatsheet: What it sounds like; a cheatsheet for R Markdown knitr: Document and code chunk options for R Markdown R Markdown Gallery: - Gallery of some R Markdown outputs Pimp my Rmd: Blog post providing a few tips to improve the appearance of output documents. For typesetting equations using R Markdown, check out: Using LaTeX to write mathematical content For integrating references into R Markdown, here are a few resources: Zotero CSL style repository Export a BibTeX file from Mendeley Export a BibTeX file from Zotero Finally, here are some references for using reveal.js and remark.js to create sweet-looking presentations: Reveal.js presentations Customizing Reveal.js presentations xaringan "],
