This is the second course of a two-semester sequence for students in education. Materials for the course can be found: Syllabus Assignments, Data, and Script Files Data Codebooks Instructor Andrew Zieffler (zief0002@umn.edu) Office: Education Sciences Building 178 Office Hours: Tuesday 9:30 AM–10:30 AM; and by appointment Teaching Assistant Jonathan Brown (brow3019@umn.edu) Office: Education Sciences Building 192 Office Hours: Thursdays 1:00 PM–3:00 PM; and by appointment Course Content The statistical content for EPsy 8252 includes: (1) likelihood estimation and inference, (2) information criteria for model selection, (3) mixed-effects/multi-level models for analysis of cross-sectional data, (4) mixed-effects/multi-level models for analysis of longitudinal data, and (5) logistic models for analyzing dichotomous outcomes. Time permitting, miscellaneous topics (e.g., design weights, empirical Bayes estimation, semi-parametric models) will also be introduced. Books and Other Reading Materials This website will serve as the primary set of course notes. In addition, the following textbook is required: Fox, J. (2009). A mathematical primer for social statistics. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. There are also two optional textbooks: Anderson, D. R. (2008). Model based inference in the life sciences: A primer on evidence. New York: Springer. Dunteman, G. H., &amp; Ho, M.-H. R. (2006). An introduction to generalized linear models. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. Prerequisites Prerequisites include EPsy 8251: Methods in Data Analysis for Educational Research I, or a sound conceptual understanding of the topics of: Foundational topics in data analysis; Design (e.g., random assignment and random sampling) Descriptive statistics and plots One- and two-sample tests Correlation; Simple regression analysis; Model-level and coefficient-level interpretation Ordinary least squares estimation Model-level and coefficient-level inference Assumption checking/residual analysis Multiple linear regression Model-level and coefficient-level interpretation and inference Assumption checking/residual analysis Working with categorical predictors (including adjusting p-values for multiple tests) Interaction effects For the topics listed, students would be expected to be able to carry out an appropriate data analysis and properly interpret the results. It is also assumed that everyone enrolled in the course has some familiarity with using R. If you need a refresher on any of these topics, see the EPsy 8251 course notes. "]
