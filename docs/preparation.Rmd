# Readings


As part of the course, there are several articles, papers and technical reports that you will need to read during the semester. Most of the articles themselves are accessible through the University of Minnesota library website (http://www.lib.umn.edu). In order to access the full text of some of the articles, you will need to log in using your University x500 username and password. More detailed information, including references or links to specific readings, are given below.


## Welcome to EPsy 8252 {#welcome}
